\begin_layout Title
Do workers discriminate against their out-group employers? Evidence from
 an online labor market
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
A large body of literature in economics has demonstrated that prejudice
 or bias of the majority group towards members of an out-group identity
 – whether it be racial, religious, ethnic or gender in origin – is widespread
 in labor markets.
 Such biases often lead to discrimination when, all else same, a less-favorable
 treatment is systematically meted out to the

 Such prejudicial treatment may reveal itself on either the extensive margin
 (the decision-to-hire stage) or the intensive margin (how much to pay,
 what sort of job conditions and work hours to offer existing employees,
 etc.).
 It is commonly believed that labor market discrimination is one-sided:
 driven by employers toward their out-group employees.

\begin_layout Standard
We make a simplifying assumption that the workers of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are homogeneous given a treatment i.e.
 they will make the same effort choice in a given treatment.
 We later relax this assumption to account for heterogeneity in effort within
 a treatment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Piece Rate Treatments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the piece rate treatments, each worker works on a task at a given piece
 rate.
 We assign four different piece rates between 0 and 10 cents.
 In the first treatment, workers are paid no piece rate.
 In the next three treatments, 
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560276686
the 
\change_unchanged
piece rates are 3, 6 and 9 cents per unit of effort.
 From the M-Turk standards, this variation in piece rates is substantial
 and is likely to elicit significant change in effort.
 The piece rates are earned on top of $1 fixed participation fee.
 These four treatments differ only in the piece rates, everything else remains
 exactly the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These piece rates provide evidence on the responsiveness of effort to incentives
 for our particular task and hence
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560276957
,
\change_unchanged
 allow us to estimate the baseline parameters (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

) which will be used to estimate other behavioral parameters.
 Formally, in the piece rate treatments, worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 observes the piece rate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and then chooses effort 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by maximizing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility"

\end_inset

.
 There is no employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in these treatments which implies that for any worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

 and there is no gift from the employer implying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbbm{1}_{Gift}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The equilibrium efforts 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 in these treatments is thus given as; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{i}^{\star}=c'^{-1}\left(s_{i}+p\right)\text{ for }i\in\left\{ B,W\right\} \text{ and \ensuremath{p\in\{0,3,6,9\}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, the solution of effort has one behavioral unknown (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

), and two unknowns from the cost function (
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

).
 To back out these parameters
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560277102
,
\change_unchanged
 we use effort corresponding to three different piece rates which gives
 us three equations to identify these three parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Altruism Treatments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the altruism treatments, each worker is matched to an employer (truthfully)
 and 
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560277242
he
\change_inserted 253428369 1560299703
/she
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560277242
 
\change_unchanged
observes the (true) value of the effort to the matched employer.
 Each employer earns 1 cent for every 100 points scored by the matched worker.
 We set the piece rate to 0.
 There are three treatments under altruism treatments.
 In the first treatment (altruism baseline) a worker does not observe the
 identity of the matched employer.
 In the 'altruism black' and 'altruism white' treatment the matched employer
 is black and white
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560277337
,
\change_unchanged
 respectively.
 Note that 
\change_inserted 253428369 1560300749

 towards the former as compared to latter.
 In other words, the difference in effort between the treatments `altruism

Once again we are implicitly assuming

, i.e.
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ij}$
\end_inset

 can be separated into two components 1) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i}$
\end_inset

, which is independent of employer racial identity, identified when 
\begin_inset Formula $j=U$
\end_inset

 and 2) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\rho_{ij}$
\end_inset

, which represents the difference in reciprocal preferences which are driven
 solely by the race of the employer.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\rho_{iW}>\Delta\rho_{iB}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\rho_{iW}<\Delta\rho_{iB}$
\end_inset

) represents the higher (lower) effort for whites as compared to blacks
 because of greater (lesser) reciprocal preference towards the former as
 compared to latter.
 In other words, the difference in effort between the treatments `reciprocity
 white' and `reciprocity black' is interpreted as resulting from the differentia
l reciprocal preferences of the workers.
 The three reciprocity treatments help us identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\rho_{iB}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\rho_{iW}$

\begin_layout Section
Experiment Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of this study is to investigate the possibility of discrimination
 from the worker side in an online labor market.
 We designed the experiment to allow for the possibility of discrimination
 in the effort by workers towards the employers.
 Our experiment is carefully designed to ensure that observed difference
 in the effort towards the employers could only realize because of the social
 preferences of workers, i.e., we shut down the possibility of statistical
 discrimination (the employers did not get to make any strategic choices
 such as wage offer, minutes of work, etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pre-registration 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

, we can use results from their study to determine the sample size that
 can achieve sufficient power for our study.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dellavigna2018"

\end_inset

 found that the points scored across all treatments have a standard deviation
 of around 660 points.
 Assuming this standard deviation for each treatment and assuming a minimum
 detectable effect of 0.2 standard deviations between two treatments, we
 will need around 400 subjects in each treatment to have a power of 80 percent.
 This implies that we will need 400 x 10= 4,000 observations in total for
 all ten treatments.
 We pre-registered the rule for sample size: we aimed to recruit 6,000 participa
nts from the United States within the first three weeks of posting the experimen
t.
 We were able to recruit ____ subjects within the first three weeks.

 us more power to make credible inferences.
 We include employer subjects of only Black and White races because we intend

Task
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed this experiment to observe whether workers discriminate in their
 effort when working for different employer types and then to back out the
 behavioral parameters of distaste.
 For this purpose, we needed a task which is costly to workers and is not
 meaningful to any particular race.
 We settled on a button-pressing task as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dellavigna2018"

\end_inset

.
 The task involves alternating presses of “a” and “b” on a keyboard for
 10 minutes.
 We settled on this task because it is simple to understand and has features
 that parallel clerical jobs: it involves repetition, and it gets tiring,
 
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560279608

Planned Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the analysis of data, we envision three main sections.
 In the first section, we will describe the collected data from M-Turkers
 including data cleaning and balance checks on the demographic data across
 treatments.
 The second section will present the treatment effects for all the ten treatment
s including the heterogeneity of the treatment effects.
 In the third section, we will estimate our structural model and get the
 estimates of the behavioral parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Cleaning and Summary Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prepare data for the analysis, we will apply some cleaning to the collected
 data.
 Specifically, we will apply
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560280299
 the
\change_unchanged
 following restrictions to the collected data: 1) we will only analyze the
 data of M-Turkers who complete the experiment i.e.
 we will not analyze the data of participants who drop out before working
 on the task, 2) we will drop all the observation that score above 4,000
 points since this is physically impossible in 10 minutes and these users
 would have used some automated script to score these points or they may
 have experienced some technical problem, 3) we will drop all the observations
 with zero points as this may reflect some malfunction or technical problem
 in points recording

no possibility of extensive margin?
\change_inserted 253428369 1560306569
 No.
 Now that we are making people to spend 10 minutes on the page, it seems
 very weird that a person will not even score a single point.
 DellaVigna and Pope dropped these observations too.
 
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\end_inset


\change_unchanged
, 4) we will drop data of users who stop the task and login again as these
 people may be trying to game the experiment by trying to be assigned to
 most rewarding treatment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are using blocked randomization design to assign subjects to treatments,
 so our treatments should be balanced on the blocked variables (gender,
 age, education, income, most-lived US state, and party affiliation).
 Nevertheless, we will present plots to test whether we get balanced treatments
 on these covariates.
 We will use Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to compare the distribution of demographics
 in these treatments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will present the summary statistics on the information collected from
 the M-Turkers to assess the representativeness of our sample as compared
 to US population.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Treatment Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will first present a table of average efforts (points scored) along with
 standard errors for each of the ten treatments.
 This table will give a sense of how the effort varies from one treatment
 to another.
 We will also plot the mean and standard deviation to document the variance
 of effort across treatments.
 This will capture in a snapshot the motivation of workers regarding the
 impact of different behavioral levers in our setting.
 For example, do the workers respond to incentives? Are the workers altruistic
 towards their employers? Do they exhibit any reciprocity? Do the race of
 the employer effects worker's performance?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data will provide us with some qualitative answers on the questions
 above by comparing the effort choices in the behavioral treatment to the
 relevant control treatment.
 For example, the comparison between `Altruism - Baseline' and `Piece Rate
 - 0 cents' will answer whether workers are altruistic towards their employers.
 Similarly comparison of effort choices in `Altruism - Baseline' and `Reciprocit
y - Baseline' will suggest evidence of reciprocity towards the employer,
 if any.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main theme of this paper is to test the difference in motivation towards
 black and white employers.
 We will use data from `Altruism - Black' and `Altruism - White' to test
 whether workers are more or less altruistic towards black versus white
 employers

at some point, we need to mention clearly that is project is all about understan

\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\end_inset


\change_unchanged
.
 Similarly, comparison of `Reciprocity - Black' and `Reciprocity - White'
 will reveal any differential reciprocal preferences towards blacks versus
 white employers.
 
\change_inserted 253428369 1560299179
Assuming normality and equal variance of distributions for each treatment,
 we may employ t-test to test for the differences in average effort.
 
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons between `Piece Rate - 0 cents', `Piece Rate - 3 cents', `Piece
 Rate - 6 cents' and `Piece Rate - 9 cents' will answer whether worker's
 effort increase with increase in the incentive for work.
 These piece rate treatments will help us calculate the elasticity of effort
 (as explained below).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also compare the cumulative distribution of effort (points scored)
 across these treatments to get the better understanding of how the effort
 choices change in each of these treatments.
 As another piece of our reduced form analysis, we will analyze the evolution
 of effort over the 10-mintues period across all these treatments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having compared the overall effort choices to examine the treatment effects,
 we can compare the treatment effects for different groups - males versus
 females, high income versus low income, highly educated versus less educated,
 blue states versus red states, and young versus old.
 Since we used the blocked randomization on these covariates to assign treatment
s, we can make these comparisons with high enough power.
 
\change_inserted 253428369 1560310614

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 253428369 1560311872
Since our race revelation mechanism is very subtle, it is possible that
 the race of the employer may not become salient to the workers.
 This can happen because a worker fails to pay attention to the video or
 he/she may have low to non-existent implicit bias towards the opposite
 race.
 To partially address this concern, we will elicit incentivized beliefs
 of workers about the matched employer after they have finished working
 on the task.
 Each worker will be incentivized to make a guess about the demographics
 of the matched employer (gender, age, race, education, income).
 We will analyze the heterogeneity in treatment effects based on whether
 workers correctly guessed the race of the employer.

We may also use the data on beliefs to understand more about the beliefs
 of white workers about the black employers relative to the white employers.
 For example, it will be interesting to see whether workers believe that
 black employers are poor relative to white employers and does this play
 a part in explaining their effort choices? Note that even though these
 beliefs may cause the differential effort for black versus white employers,
 these effort choices are still purely driven by the social preferences
 of workers.

Estimation of Structural Model

\begin_layout Standard
We designed our experiment with the structural model given in Section 2.
 The advantage of designing field experiments on the basis of model of behavior
 is that it allows researchers to estimate the nuisance parameters in the
 environment that is relevant to the decision making

.
 Because of the simplicity of our task, there are only three nuisance parameters
 that we need to estimate.
 We will thus use data from the piece rate treatments to identify these
 parameters.
 Once we have the estimate of these nuisance parameters, we can estimate
 behavioral parameters using data from the social preference treatments.
 We closely follow the estimation procedure in

 to estimate our model.

\begin_layout Standard
We will first use minimum distance estimation method to estimate these parameter
s.
 In the minimum distance estimation one identifies the set of moments in
 data (average effort) and then find the set of model parameters that minimizes
 the distance between the empirical moments and the theory-predicted moments.
 To estimate nuisance parameters, we will use data from the piece rate treatment
s.
 Specifically, we will use the average effort corresponding to three piece
 rates (0 cents, 3 cents and 9 cents), to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Once these parameters are estimated, we will use average effort corresponding
 to altruism treatment to estimate behavioral parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Having estimated nuisance parameters and baseline altruism parameter, we
 will use average effort in `Altruism - Black' and `Altruism - White' to
 estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{Black}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{White}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Similarly, to calculate baseline reciprocity parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, we will use average effort from `Rec

 as given.
 Finally, we will estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{Black}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{White}$

 We will derive confidence interval for these parameters using a bootstrap
 procedure.

\begin_layout Standard
The minimum distance estimator just relies on the moment and hence
\change_inserted 2090806916 1560280816
,
\change_unchanged
 does not use all the variation in the data.
 There are methods such as maximum likelihood and non-linear least squares
 that can be used to estimate these parameters using all the variation in
 the data.
 We will use non-linear least square method to estimate these parameters
 allowing for the heterogeneous cost of effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in section 2, we will use both the power and the exponential
 cost function to estimate these parameters.
