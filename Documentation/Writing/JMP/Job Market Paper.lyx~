Do workers discriminate against their out-group employers? Evidence from
 an online labor market

\begin_layout Abstract
The issue of discrimination is explored at great length in economic literature
 however almost all the literature has tend to investigate the issue on
 the premise that discrimination is always driven by the employers.
 In the present study we investigate the issue from a different angle and
 investigate whether discrimination can run in an opposite direction i.e.
 whether workers from one group may exhibit biases towards the employers
 from the other group when working for opposite group employers.
 To our knowledge the possibility of racial bias from the worker side has
 not been explored in the economic literature.
 We design a model based real effort experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk
 to answer our research questions.
 This study serves as a pilot for the full study that will be implemented
 based on the learning from this exercise.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large body of literature in economics has demonstrated that discrimination
 – whether it be racial, religious, ethnic or gender in origin – is widespread
 in labor markets

.
 However, almost all the literature has tend to investigate the issue on
 the premise that discrimination is driven by the employers i.e.
 employers have some animus

 or beliefs about the productivity of workers

\end_inset

 from disadvantaged group and that leads them to discriminate against the
 equally productive workers from the disadvantaged group in favor of workers
 from the advantaged group.
 In this study we investigate the issue from a different angle and see whether
 discrimination can run in the opposite direction i.e.
 whether a worker from the advantaged (disadvantaged) group may exhibit
 bias towards the employer from the disadvantaged (advantaged) group.
 To be specific, we explore whether workers exhibit bias when providing
 effort based on employer's racial identity? To our knowledge the possibility
 of discrimination from this direction has not been explored in the economics
 literature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand what we mean by discrimination from the worker
 side and why is it an important issue that merits investigation.
 We define worker discrimination as when employers from one group are treated
 differently (less favorably) than employers from another group with identical
 characteristics.
 For example, workers discriminate when they under-provide effort to employers
 from one group as compared to the other group with otherwise identical
 characteristics (such as wages, job conditions etc.).
 The investigation of this issue is important for several reasons.
 First, in the absence of perfectly enforceable contracts, this form of
 discrimination directly affects the profitability of the employers because
 of workers under-performance.
 Second, it can provide a partial explanation for why employers tend to
 have lower callbacks for workers from the opposite group, as observed in
 studies such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bertrand2004"

\end_inset

.
 That is, if employers expect that workers from a particular group are going
 to under-provide effort then it is rational for even unbiased employers
 to not hire from that group.
 Finally, this line of research can also explain why discrimination, even
 after various affirmative action policies by governments all over the world,
 continue to exist in one form or another 
\begin_inset ERT

citep{Bayer2017}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 One possible explanation for why those policies haven't achieved the discrimina
tion free society could be that those policies were aimed at employers and
 they were perceived as the only entity responsible for causing discrimination.
 However, our research aims to investigate if discrimination can also be
 driven by those who are traditionally "discriminated against" and if it
 is, then one needs to target both sides of market to address the issue
 of discrimination

Fundamentally, economists view discrimination as arising in one of two ways.

tion exists because of prejudice/animus of the advantaged group toward the
 disadvantaged group.

 instead view discrimination as statistical, in which an employer, lacking
 information about the worker's productivity, forms belief about the worker's
 productivity based on worker's group identity using the aggregate distribution
 of worker's group traits.

 for the nice review of models of discrimination.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For the purpose of our research, we make the similar distinction about
 the discrimination from the worker side.
 We define taste-based discrimination as the discrimination that results
 because of animus or prejudice of workers towards the employer's group
 identity.
 For example, if a White worker prefers working for a White employer as
 compared to the equally rewarding opportunity from a Black employer, then
 we call this taste-based discrimination against the Black employer.
 Statistical discrimination from the worker side would be the discrimination
 that results when a worker, lacking information on the employer, forms
 beliefs about the desirability of the job with the employer using stereotypes
 about the group of employer.
 For example, a White worker may believe (correctly or incorrectly) that
 Blacks employers are generally less generous (in compensations; monetary
 or otherwise) towards their workers as compared to White employers and
 therefore the worker may discriminate against the Black employer in favor
 of the equally desirable job from the White employer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research question is close to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Glover2015b"

\end_inset

; in their study the authors found that disadvantaged-group workers under-provid
e effort when working under the biased managers.
 However, our study is different in a sense that we argue that workers may
 under-provide effort even in the absence of bias from the employer.
 Ours is the only study which explores the possibility of bias driven from
 the worker side in the absence of any discrimination or anticipation of
 discrimination from the employer.
 Another closely related study is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Craig2018"

\end_inset

, in which the authors build a theoretical model allowing for the possibility
 of statistical discrimination from both worker and employer side.
 However, the authors do not allow for the possibility of taste bias from
 worker side.
 They also do not provide any empirical evidence to support the claim.
 Ours is the first study to explore the possibility of taste bias from worker
 side and presents an experimental evidence to test the claim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discrimination by workers can be on various margins, however, in this
 paper we explore the discrimination in productivity by the workers towards
 the employer's racial identity.
 Specifically, we are interested in answering whether workers provide more/less
 effort for White employers as compared to Black employers given that they
 are already working for the employer and thus there is no option of choosing
 an employer.
 So we need a setting in which 1) workers work on a task in which productivity
 can be measured 2) they do not choose their employer and 3) employer identity
 can be revealed to workers in an unobtrusive way

 is based on a model of behavior to identify the parameters of taste.

for motivation on using structural models for design of experiments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Based on the model, we come up with two set of treatments: Baseline and
 Race Salient Treatments.
 In the baseline treatments, workers do not observe the identity of the
 employer and only observe the selected wage by the employer before starting
 to work on the task.
 In race salient treatments, each worker observes the race of the employer
 along with the chosen wage rate before starting to work on the task.
 In either of these treatments, an employer selects a wage offer for a worker,
 the worker observes the selected wage and then works on the task.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test whether workers exhibit taste bias in providing effort to the employer,
 we run an artefactual field experiment

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 using subjects from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (M-Turk).
 Here is how the experiment is implemented; 1) we post an assignment for
 a demographic survey on M-Turk, 2) subjects who report their race as either
 Black or White in the survey are asked to initiate the experiment 3) upon
 initiation a subject is randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups
 and to the role of employer or worker a' la 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Fehr1993"

\end_inset

.
 Each employer is (truthfully) matched with a unique worker.
 Each employer selects a wage rate for the matched workers (the choice is
 framed such that a higher wage for a worker means a lower return for the
 employer).
 The worker observe the chosen wage by his/her matched employer and then
 works on a simple button-pressing task for up-to ten minutes
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The button-pressing task is adopted from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 in which workers press 'a' followed by 'b' on their keyboard to score a
 point.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The wage rate serves as an incentive for working on the task for workers.
 The worker is also informed of the return to the employer from his/her
 effort.
 In the baseline treatment, workers do not observe the race of the matched
 employer, while in race salient treatments the race is revealed using a
 picture of the hand of the employer 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citep{Doleac2013}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The picture was taken by the employer using his/her web-camera.
 Worker's identity is never revealed to the matched employer.
 We give four wage options to employers, therefore the baseline treatment
 consists of 4 sub-treatments.
 In the race salient treatment, a wage is chosen by either a Black or a
 White employer, so there are 8 sub-treatments in this treatment.
 Therefore, we basically have 12 sub-treatments, which are endogenously
 determined by the racial composition of the sample and the wage choices
 by the employers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our final sample for this pilot study consists of 202 subjects (37 Blacks
 and 165 Whites).
 Overall we do not observe significant differences in effort choices for
 black employers versus white employers at any of the possible wage levels
 because of the very limited sample that we collect.
 We observe the positive correlation between wage rate and effort in both
 baseline and race salient treatments, however we remain unable to test
 for this wage-effort relationship on the basis of employer's race.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the data from the baseline treatment, we estimate the parameters of
 the cost of effort function, which are then taken as given for the estimation
 of taste parameters towards black or white employers.
 We find that the taste parameter for black employers is higher in magnitude
 than for white employers, implying that workers derive higher satisfaction
 from working for the black employer as compared to the white employer.
 However, these parameters have enormous standard errors and therefore we
 do not have any confidence in these estimates.

This research relates to the broad literature on discrimination in the labor
 markets.
 As explained earlier we specifically look at worker's vertical discrimination
 towards their employers, complementing a larger literature about horizontal
 discrimination between co-workers (e.g.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We make a simplifying assumption that the workers of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are homogeneous given a treatment i.e.
 they will make the same effort choice in a given treatment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Piece Rate Treatments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the piece rate treatments, each worker works on a task at a given piece
 rate.
 We assign four different piece rates between 0 and 10 cents.
 In the first treatment, workers are paid no piece rate.
 In the next three treatments, piece rates are 3, 6 and 9 cents per unit
 of effort.
 From the M-Turk standards, this variation in piece rates is substantial
 and is likely to elicit significant change in effort.
 The piece rates are earned on top of $1 fixed participation fee.
 These four treatments differ only in the piece rates, everything else remains
 exactly the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These piece rates provide evidence on the responsiveness of effort to incentives
 for our particular task and hence allow us to estimate the baseline parameters
 (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

) which will be used to estimate other behavioral parameters.
 Formally, in the piece rate treatments, worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 observes the piece rate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and then chooses effort 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by maximizing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility"

\end_inset

.
 There is no employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in these treatments which implies that for any worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

 and there is no gift from the employer implying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbbm{1}_{Gift}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The equilibrium efforts 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 in these treatments is thus given as; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{i}^{\star}=c'^{-1}\left(s_{i}+p\right)\text{ for }i\in\left\{ B,W\right\} \text{ and \ensuremath{p\in\{0,3,6,9\}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, the solution of effort has one behavioral unknown (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

), and two unknowns from the cost function (
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

).
 To back out these parameters we use effort corresponding to three different
 piece rates which gives us three equations to identify these three parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Altruism Treatments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the altruism treatments, each worker is matched to an employer (truthfully)
 and observes the (true) value of the effort to the matched employer.
 Each employer earns 1 cent for every 100 points scored by the matched worker.
 We set the piece rate to 0.
 There are three treatments under altruism treatments.
 In the first treatment (altruism baseline) a worker does not observe the
 identity of the matched employer.
 In the 'altruism black' and 'altruism white' treatment the matched employer
 is black and white respectively.
 Note that we only model 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are implicitly assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ij}=\alpha_{i}+\Delta\alpha_{ij}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ij}$
\end_inset

 can be separated into two components 1) 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, which is independent of employer racial identity, identified when 
\begin_inset Formula $j=U$
\end_inset

 and 2) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\alpha_{ij}$
\end_inset

, which represents the difference in altruistic preferences which are driven
 solely by the race of the employer.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\alpha_{iW}>\Delta\alpha_{iB}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\alpha_{iW}<\Delta\alpha_{iB}$
\end_inset

) represents the higher (lower) effort for whites as compared to blacks
 because of greater (lesser) altruistic preference towards the former as
 compared to latter.
 In other words, the difference in effort between the treatments `altruism
 white' and `altruism black' is interpreted as resulting from the differential
 altruistic preferences of the workers.
 The three altruism treatments help us identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\alpha_{iB}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\alpha_{iW}$
\end_inset

 given the baseline parameters.

\begin_layout Subsection
Reciprocity Treatments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reciprocity treatments build on from the altruism treatments and add a positive
 monetary gift (20 cents) from the employer to the worker.
 Rest of the details are exactly the same as in altruism treatments.
 The equilibrium effort is thus given as;

\begin_layout Standard
Once again we are implicitly assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ij}=\rho_{i}+\Delta\rho_{ij}$

 the parameter

 In other words, the difference in effort between the treatments `reciprocity

\begin_layout Section
Experiment Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of this study is to investigate the possibility of discrimination
 from the worker side in an online labor market.
 We designed the experiment to allow for the possibility of discrimination
 in the effort by workers towards the employers.
 Our experiment is carefully designed to ensure that observed difference
 in the effort towards the employers could only realize because of the social
 preferences of workers, i.e., we shut down the possibility of statistical
 discrimination (the employers did not get to make any strategic choices
 such as wage offer, minutes of work, etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pre-registration 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We pre-registered the design on AEA RCT registry as AEARCTR-0003885.
 Since our choice of the task is the same as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dellavigna2018"

\end_inset

, we can use results from their study to determine the sample size that
 can achieve sufficient power for our study.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dellavigna2018"

\end_inset

 found that the points scored across all treatments have a standard deviation
 of around 660 points.
 Assuming this standard deviation for each treatment and assuming a minimum
 detectable effect of 0.2 standard deviations between two treatments, we
 will need around 400 subjects in each treatment to have a power of 80 percent.
 This implies that we will need 400 x 10= 4,000 observations in total for
 all ten treatments.
 We pre-registered the rule for sample size: we aimed to recruit 6,000 participa
nts from the United States within the first three weeks of posting the experimen
t.
 We were able to recruit ____ subjects within the first three weeks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recruitment of Subjects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since this study involves the understanding of worker's motivation towards
 their employers, we needed to recruit both employers and workers for this
 experiment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Recruitment of Employers 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recruit employers, we invited male student subjects, above the age of
 18, from Iowa State University, who racially identified as either African
 American or Caucasian.
 We randomly assigned each employer subject to one of the six social preference
 treatments.
 Based on the assigned treatment, subjects read from the script and demonstrated
 the task on a video.
 Each subject was paid $5 for showing up to our lab and an average additional
 amount of ___ based on matched workers performance.
 Our final sample included six employers in each social preference treatment
 (36 employers).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Recruitment of Workers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recruited the workers for this experiment from an online labor market,
 Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
 Mechanical Turk is a crowd-sourcing web-service that allows employers (called
 requester) to get tasks (called Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs)) executed
 by employees (called workers) in exchange for a wage (called reward).
 Mechanical Turk is a widely used platform in research in economics and
 gives access to a large pool of applicants at a much affordable rate hence
 allowing for the well-powered study.

 for a discussion on demographic characteristics and representation of subjects
 from Mechanical Turk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recruit subjects we posted the screen-er survey as the HIT on Mechanical
 Turk with the following description “Fill out this 2-minute screener survey
 to qualify for a study that starts immediately, take up to 15 minutes,
 and pays participation bonus $1 with scope to earn extra.
 You will be required to watch and listen to a video.
 Do NOT take this study on mobile.”.
 Based on the responses in the screener survey; we invited participants
 above the age of 18 who reported their race as “Black or African American”
 or “White or Caucasian” to participate in the experiment.
 We paid five cents to each subject who did not meet the criteria.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Task
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed this experiment to observe whether workers discriminate in their
 effort when working for different employer types and then to back out the
 behavioral parameters of distaste.
 For this purpose, we needed a task which is costly to workers and is not
 meaningful to any particular race.
 We settled on a button-pressing task as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dellavigna2018"

\end_inset

.
 The task involves alternating presses of “a” and “b” on a keyboard for
 10 minutes.
 We settled on this task because it is simple to understand and has features
 that parallel clerical jobs: it involves repetition, and it gets tiring,
 thus testing the motivation of the workers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Race Revelation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We took the approach of revealing race via the revelation of skin-color
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citep{Doleac2013}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 To that end, we recorded videos of employers while they read off a script
 explaining and demonstrating the task.
 The camera placement only captured the hand of the employer along with
 the movement of the fingers alternating ‘a’ and ‘b’ button presses.
 Other identifiers, such as the face, were not captured in the video to
 avoid psychological confounds which are associated with faces, such as
 attractiveness and trustworthiness 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citep{Eckel2011}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The employer’s hand was bare or covered (with full sleeves and latex gloves)
 depending on the assigned treatment.
 For black employers, we only restricted to participants with dark skin
 tone to avoid any ambiguity about the race of the person.
 We used the digital voice for the videos in the piece rate treatments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment proceeded as follows: (1) We recruited employers from Iowa
 State University and recorded videos of them explaining the task, 2) we
 then posted a HIT on Amazon's Mechanical Turk for a screener survey for
 the recruitment of workers, (3) we invited subjects who consented and met
 the recruitment criteria (undisclosed) to initiate the experiment, (4)
 upon initiation we assigned each subject to one of the treatment groups.
 Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Czibor2019"

\end_inset

, we used the blocked randomization design to assign subjects to treatments.
 We defined blocks based on demographic information collected in the screener
 survey (Gender, Age, Race, Education, Income, Political Party Affiliation,
 and the Most-lived US State).

Notes: The table list all the treatments in this study.
 Each piece rate treatment differs just in the last line of the script,
 used the digital voice, and concealed the skin color of the hand.
 Social preference treatments (altruism and reciprocity) begin with the
 introduction of the employer (in the first person), explain the task using
 the same script as in piece rate treatments and then differ only in the
 last paragraph of the script.
 Both altruism and reciprocity categories have three treatments, each with
 black, white, and concealed skin tone of the employer.
 In the social preference treatments of concealed skin tone, the ratio of
 black and white employers was 1:1.

On the next page, you will play a simple button-pressing task.
 The object of the task is to alternately press the `a' and `b' buttons
 on your keyboard as quickly as possible for ten minutes.
 Every time you successfully press the `a' and then the `b' button, you
 will receive a point.
 Note that points will only be rewarded when you alternate button pushes:
 just pressing the `a' or `b' button without alternating between the two
 will not result in points.
 Buttons must be pressed by hand only (key-bindings or automated button-pushing
 programs/scripts cannot be used), or task will not be approved.
 Feel free to score as many points as you can.

In the altruism and reciprocity treatments, each video started with the

Hi, I am another participant in this study who is matched to you.
 In this study, you will work on a simple button-pressing task, and I will

 with the last paragraph being the only difference.
 The wording is provided in table

.
 There were three treatments each in the category of altruism and reciprocity.
 Altruism baseline and reciprocity baseline concealed the skin color of
 the employer using latex gloves.
 Although the voice in the baseline treatments can reveal some racial markers,
 we recruited an equal number of black and white employers in these treatments,
 therefore, on average, the effect of race from voice, if any, should cancel
 out in the baseline treatments.
 The videos showed in the altruism black (white), and reciprocity black
 (white) revealed the black (white) skin of the employers.

 There were 483 subjects who filled out the screen-er survey, 331 of them
 qualified to participate in the experiment.
 Since an employer and a worker constitute a group, we dropped a group if
 a worker in that group dropped out of the experiment before starting to
 work on the task.
 We ended up dropping 34 groups because of worker attrition.
 We additionally dropped 5 groups because workers in these groups joined
 our experiment using mobile phones and the app did not allow them to score
 points on the button-pressing task.
 22 other groups were dropped because they failed to score any point, this
 is likely to be due to some technical issue at the worker's end.
 We were finally left with 101 groups (202 subjects).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of the workers (12% of workers who started the experiment) dropped
 out at the stage of control questions.
 These are probably those subjects who did not understand instructions and
 did not bother spending time to understand them.
 Workers in our experiment could not move forward without answering these
 control questions correctly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed the interface for this experiment to ensure that pages by employers
 auto submit after certain time has elapsed on each page.
 This made sure that even if an employer dropped out, a matched worker would
 still be able to proceed with the experiment rather than waiting indefinitely
 for the employer's decision.
 We went with the default choice for piece rate of 0 cents per 100 points
 if the employer dropped out before selecting a piece rate for a worker.
 We revealed the employer's race as black if the employer dropped out before
 taking a picture in race salient treatment.
 We use these default choices because we expected limited number of choices
 of 0 cents per 100 points and limited number of blacks.
 Also, as the first person to join the group was assigned the role of employer,
 he/she could make a decision without waiting for a worker, hence by the
 time the worker joined, employer may have already selected a piece rate
 for him/her.
 This design allowed us to control attrition by workers from waiting for
 the employer.
 Eventually only 2 workers dropped out while waiting for the employer.
 There were 15 employers who dropped out before selecting a piece rate,
 but we still use the data from their corresponding workers (who saw a piece
 rate of 0 cents per 100 points and a race of Black

Pictures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All subjects in our experiment were required to take a picture of the back
 of their hand using webcam.
 We use that picture to verify if the reported race is consistent with the
 observed color of the skin.
 Since we are only looking at Black and White pictures, it is easier to
 identify the race from the skin color of the subject.
 The majority (96 percent) of our subjects reported race correctly, in a
 few other instances the reported race was ambiguous or incorrect as compared
 to the pictures.
 We could also figure out the gender from the taken pictures because of
 masculinity of the hand, the display of jewelry, and in some cases from
 the body frame of the subject.
 In 90 percent of the cases gender was consistent with the reported gender,
 while in other cases it could not be discerned from the picture or the
 gender was incorrectly reported.
 It should be noted that incorrect reporting of race or gender in this case
 is not an issue, because these pictures or the reported race were never
 revealed to the other participant and hence could not influence behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pictures that were revealed to the workers were the pictures of piece
 rates taken by employers.
 As already mentioned these pictures were only revealed in the race salient
 treatment.
 We analyze whether the observed race from the picture is consistent with
 reported race.
 In-case the race revealed from the picture is not same as reported race,
 we use the race from the picture to determine the treatment status for
 the worker in race salient treatment.
 The piece-rate images had a large variance in how much of the person's
 hand was revealed.
 A little over 75 percent of the employers in the race salient treatment
 provided images where their hands were at least partially visible.
 However, many of these images showed only one or two fingers or their skin
 was a very small portion of the image.
 Alternatively, a small minority of employers in the race salient treatment
 provided images where they showed their entire hands or even showed their
 faces.
 Of the pictures which showed part of the hand, not all the pictures could
 clearly be identified as either Black or White.
 Only around 70 percent of pictures from race salient treatment were such
 that a race could be identified from the shown picture.
 This proportion is quite low given the small number of observations in
 the race salient treatment, we should remove these observations (employer
 and worker pair) from the analysis to make sure that workers actually observed
 the race with piece rate in the picture, however because of the limited
 number of observations we do not drop these pairs and therefore the results
 should be interpreted with caution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue that we need to be concerned about is the revelation of gender
 along with race in some of the pictures.
 In 35 percent of the pictures in the race salient treatment gender could
 be identified by the worker because of a combination of the factors such
 as painted nails, wedding ring style, and a revealed face or torso.
 We do not control for this effect because gender revelation was not significant
ly different between Black employers and White employers in the race salient
 treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on what we learned from this experiment, we are less inclined to use
 pictures to reveal race in the full study.
 Some of our subjects also expressed concern when using the web-camera for
 M-Turk even though these pictures were not collecting any personally identifiab
le information

\begin_layout Standard
We present effort by treatments and piece rates in table

.
 Incentives have powerful effect on effort, raising performance from an
 average of 1125 points (0-cent piece rate) to 1926 points (9-cent piece
 rate) in the baseline treatment.
 The standard errors for mean effort are very large for all the treatments
 because of the limited sample that we collected.
 Because of the small sample size, we don't have sufficient power to detect
 the difference in effort between treatments at different piece rates, so
 we won't make those comparisons here.

 presents the reduced form estimates from the OLS regressions.
 Clearly, piece rate has a strong effect on effort and is the main driver
 of effort in all the given specifications.
 Workers provide slightly more effort in the Race Salient treatment as compared
 to Baseline treatment.
 The higher effort in race salient treatment may be due to increased salience
 of employer/task as the worker could see the picture taken by the employer
 and hence employer's existence is made more salient.
 However, this effect of pictures is not significant once we control for
 the demographic information of the workers.
 The main coefficient of interest in this specification is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Race Salient x Black Employer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, this shows that Black employers in the Race Salient treatment are eliciting
 significantly more effort as compared to White employers in the same treatment.
 But once again these coefficients should be interpreted with caution as
 we do not have enough power to detect the effect sizes.

 the collected data enable us to better understand the choices from the
 experiment.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 compares the distribution of piece rates chosen by employers with the piece
 rate as deemed fair by the workers.
 More than 80 percent of workers deem piece rate of at-least 6 cents as
 fair as compared to only around 50 percent of employers actually making
 the offer of 6 cents or more.
 It seems as though workers identify 6 cents as the standard for fairness.
 Also workers may also have the sense that since they are the ones doing
 the work, they should earn more than the employer and that may explain
 why most workers think that they should receive a larger share of pie.

\begin_layout Section
Structural Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed our experiment with the structural model given in Section 2.
 The advantage of designing field experiments on the basis of model of behavior
 is that it allows researchers to estimate the nuisance parameters in the
 environment that are relevant to the decision making 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citep{DellaVigna2017}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Because of the simplicity of our task, the nuisance parameters only enter
 the cost function.
 We will thus use data from the baseline treatment to identify these parameters.
 Once we have the estimate of these nuisance parameters, we can estimate
 parameters of taste/distaste using data from the race salient treatments.
 We will now present the estimation procedure and the resulting estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use data from the baseline treatment, specifically the average effort
 corresponding to three piece rates (0 cents, 3 cents and 9 cents), to estimate
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 using minimum distance estimation.
 In the minimum distance estimation one identifies the set of moments in
 data (average effort) and then find the set of model parameters that minimizes
 the distance between the empirical moments and the theory-predicted moments.
 The minimum distance estimator just relies on the moment and hence does
 not use all the variation in the data.
 There are methods such as maximum likelihood and non-linear least squares
 that can be used to estimate these parameters using all the variation in
 data but we do not run those estimations for this pilot.
 We effectively assume that all workers in a treatment are homogeneous and
 do not exhibit heterogeneity in any of the behavioral parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The estimates of the minimum distance estimator are presented in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:StructuralEstimates"

\end_inset

 for the power cost function.
 Given these estimates, we would then back out the estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta s_{ij}$
\end_inset

 for each piece rate (0, 3, 6 or 9 cents) by using the average effort in
 the race salient treatment corresponding to the respective piece rate for
 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{B,W\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\{B,W\}$
\end_inset

.
 However, because of limited data that we collected, we don't have enough
 observations to calculate these 12 parameters.
 Instead we just estimate two parameters - one for black employers and other
 for white employers ignoring the variation in piece rate.
 This means that we are assuming both Black and White workers to have same
 taste/distaste from working for the White/Black employer for each level
 of piece rate.
 That is, the average effort by workers (Black and White) for White employers
 for all piece rates in the race salient treatment is given by; 
\end_layout

\[
e_{.W}^{RS}=c'^{-1}\left(\left(s+\Delta s_{.W}\right)\right)

, however the standard errors are huge because of small sample size and
 thus large variation in the observed effort choices.
 The taste parameter is positive for both employer types, implying race
 revelation leads to larger effort as compared to the baseline treatment.
 The magnitude of the taste parameter is higher for black employers as compared
 to white, implying that black employers elicit more effort.
 However, once again because of enormous standard errors, we don't have
 any confidence in these estimates.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do workers discriminate in effort based on the social identity of the employer?
 Is it possible for the worker side to exhibit a taste bias towards the
 employer in an environment of no possibility of statistical bias? Does
 fairness play a role in the effort decision of the workers when the punishment
 is costly to workers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed a pilot experiment on Amazon's Mechanical Turk to answer the
 above questions.
 The model-based experiment design consisted of 12 treatment arms.
 Four piece-rate treatments with no information on employer's identity,
 and other eight treatments with revealed employer's race (Black or White)
 at each of the 4 piece rates.
 The worker's identity was always hidden so as not to confound behavior
 from employers in the worker's effort choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that monetary incentives work as expected i.e.
 higher piece rate lead to more effort in all the treatments.
 We do not find any discriminatory preferences among workers towards Black
 or White employers i.e.
 the effort provided to white employer is statistically not different from
 effort provided to the black employer.
 This once again highlights the fact that monetary incentive are considered
 more important in this environment than the social identity of employers
 and are the main driver of effort.
 We also do not find any concerns for reciprocity among workers.
 Although some workers do express discontentment when a lower piece rate
 is selected by employers (as observed from their optional feedback), the
 monetary incentive still take precedence over these concerns and the average
 effort is not statistically affected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since this study was only a pilot, there are significant limitation in the
 presented results and hence we do not interpret any of the results more
 than as noise.
 This is because of the limited sample size in each of our treatment cells
 and the resulting enormous standard errors.
 For the full study we are revising the design to answer the above questions
 among others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the first study attempting to understand discrimination from the
 non-traditional side of the market and there is huge room for further research
 in this area.
 In an ongoing work, we are exploring issues such as the possibility of
 discrimination in reciprocity by workers, the documentation of statistical
 discrimination by workers and the general equilibrium interaction of discrimina
tion from both sides of the market (employer and workers).
 We believe there is lot of research needed to fully explore the possibility
 of discrimination from this non-traditional side of the market.
 More evidence of this reverse discrimination or its lack in different environme
nts and contexts will help improve our understanding of the issue.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on this pilot, we need to revise our research design as follows; 1)
 there is considerable ambiguity in the way race was revealed, we need to
 come up with another way of revealing race, 2) the current experimental
 design was not adequate because it lead to a disproportional number of
 observations in each treatment cell.
 We need to come up with a design in which treatment status is determined
 a priori and not endogenously determined during the experiment, 3) since
 our research question is aimed at examining the worker's problem we probably
 don't need to hire as many employers as we did for this experiment.
 It may be possible to use one employer for more than one worker, 4) since
 it is not easy to recruit blacks on M-Turk, we may way to restrict only
 to white workers and study their performance for black versus white employers,
 5) we also need to record the intensity of effort throughout the duration
 of task to see how it changes over time.
 We did not record this data for this pilot.
