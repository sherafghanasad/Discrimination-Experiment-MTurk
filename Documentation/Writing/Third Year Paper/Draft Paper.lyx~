Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large body of literature in economics has demonstrated that prejudice
 or bias – whether it be racial, religious, ethnic or gender in origin –
 is widespread in labor markets.
 Frequently, such biases reveal themselves as deliberate discrimination
 in actual labor market decision-making.
 The most common form of such discrimination studied is of the employer-to-emplo
yee kind, that shown by an employer from one group toward a potential or
 existing employee from another group.
 Such discrimination can be along an “extensive” margin (e.g., unwarranted
 low interviewing or hiring of job-seekers from a certain group) or along
 an “intensive margin” (e.g.
 deliberate unfairness in compensation, pecuniary or otherwise).
 Researchers have established that discrimination along either margin is
 emphatically costly and demoralizing to those being discriminated against:
 it may cause inefficiently-low job seeking or suboptimal investment in
 skill or human capital by minority workers

; it may directly reduce their performance

\begin_layout Standard
Fundamentally, economists view discrimination as arising in one of two ways.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Becker1957"

\end_inset

 introduced the notion of taste-based discrimination postulating that discrimina
tion exists because of prejudice/animus of the majority toward the minority.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Phelps1972a"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Arrow1973c"

\end_inset

 instead view discrimination as statistical, in which, say, a majority group-emp
loyer, lacking information, say, on a minority group-worker, forms rational
 beliefs about the worker in terms of the aggregate distribution of group
 traits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost all of this literature on discrimination has tend to investigate
 the issue on the premise that discrimination is always driven by the employer
 i.e.
 employers have some animus or beliefs about the productivity of minority
 workers and that leads them to discriminate against the equally productive
 minority workers in favor of workers from the majority group.
 In this study we investigate the issue from a different angle and see whether
 discrimination can run in opposite direction i.e.
 whether a worker from the majority (minority) group may exhibit bias towards
 the employer from the minority (majority) group when considering to work
 for opposite group employers.
 To our knowledge the possibility of discrimination from this direction
 has never been explored in the economic literature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this research is twofold, first to investigate whether the
 discrimination can be driven from the worker side and second what is the
 nature of this discrimination - taste or statistical? Is it that workers
 exhibit distaste towards the employers from opposite group or is it that
 the discrimination is statistical in nature where workers have some beliefs
 or stereotypes towards the opposite group employer and they invoke those
 when working for the employer.
 The distinction is important because each kind of discrimination warrants
 different policy prescriptions for addressing the problem of discrimination.
 So in a nutshell this paper aims to first document whether racial discriminatio
n exists from employee-to-employer in the biggest online labor market, and
 if it exists which economic theory best explains the existence of discriminatio
n.

\begin_layout Standard
Discrimination in labor markets is a decades old problem and even after
 various affirmative action policies by governments all over the world it
 continue to exist in one form or another.
 One possible explanation for why those policies haven't achieved the discrimina
tion free society could be that those policies were aimed at employers and
 they were perceived as the only entity responsible for causing discrimination.
 However our research identified that discrimination can also be driven
 by those who are traditionally "discriminated against" and if one is to
 tackle the issue it needs to target both sides of market i.e.
 employers and workers.
 For example we find that workers discriminate against the employers from
 minority group, then the right prescription to deal with the problem would
 be to address workers concerns that may discourage them for working with
 the opposite group employers (aim of future research).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address our research question we make use of the gift exchange framework

 for the worker side and modify it to incorporate employer side, possiblity
 of discrimination from worker side and the notion of reciprocity by workers.
 Assuming risk neurtality, a worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\left\{ B,W\right\} $
\end_inset

 solves the following problem when working for an employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\left\{ B,W\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 denote the black or white race of an agent (employer or worker) respectively;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\underbrace{max}_{e_{ij}\geq0}U_{ij}=\underbrace{max}_{e_{ij}\geq0}\left(F_{j}+(s_{ij}+p)e_{ij}-c(e_{ij})+Y_{ij}\kappa_{ij}\lambda_{iji}\right)\label{eq:utility}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{ij}$
\end_inset

is the number of points (on a button-pressing task) scored by worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 when working for employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the fixed money paid just for working on a task, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{ij}$
\end_inset

 (as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) captures the sense of duty, norm, intrinsict motivation, and competitiveness
 of worker towards the task.
 We argue that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{ij}$
\end_inset

 also include the taste (like or dislike) of worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 towards the employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 per unit of effort 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the piece rate chosen by the employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, we allow employers to select piece rate from anywhere between 0 cents
 and 10 cents per 100 points.
 
\begin_inset Formula $c(e_{ij})$
\end_inset

 is the cost of effort, following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 we assume cost fucntion to have either power or exponential functional
 form i.e.
 
\end_layout

\begin{equation}
c(e)=\frac{ke^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}\label{eq:Power Cost Function}

or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c(e)=\frac{kexp^{\gamma e}}{\gamma}\label{eq:Exponential Cost Function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These functions differ in their elasticity of effort with respect to the
 value of effort.
 Power cost function (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Power Cost Function"

\end_inset

) characterize a costant elasticity of effort given by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\gamma$
\end_inset

 while exponential cost function (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Exponential Cost Function"

\end_inset

) implies a decreasing elasticity as effort increases.
 Both functions requires the estimation of unknowns 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 which we will back out using observed effort at different piece rates.

where 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}^{fair}$

represents worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's belief about fair effort that he/she can provide and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{fair}$

 represents a worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's beleif about the fair piece rate that the employer could have offered.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We elicit these beliefs directly from the workers by asking them what would
 they consider as a fair piece rate.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{iji}<0$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 if a worker believes that the selected piece rate is less than the fair
 piece rate, then a worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 will respond by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{ij}<0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 by choosing less effort than what would be considered fair by the worker.
 Our parameter of interest in the above specficaition is 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{ij}$
\end_inset

i.e.
 we are interested in finding whether workers reciprocate and wheter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

reciprocity sensitivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 varies for employer types.
 Our choice of kindness functions is very simple but it captures the essential
 idea of reciprocity, it can be shown that more complicated functional forms
 lead to same conclusions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{ij}^{\star}=c'^{-1}\left(s_{ij}+p+Y_{ij}\left(p-p_{i}^{fair}\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implying that effort is increasing in the belief about kindness of employer
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\lambda_{iji}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In other words higher piece rate from employer is construed as kind behavior
 by worker and hence encourage reciprocal workers (for whom 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{ij}>0$
\end_inset

) to put more effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With power cost function this translates to; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{ij}^{\star}=\left(\frac{s_{ij}+p+Y_{ij}\left(p-p_{i}^{fair}\right)}{k}\right)^{1/\gamma}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While exponential cost function lead to the solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{ij}^{\star}=\frac{1}{\gamma}log\left(\frac{s_{ij}+p+Y_{ij}\left(p-p_{i}^{fair}\right)}{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We make a simplifying assumption that the workers of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are homogenous given a treatment i.e.
 they will make the same effort choice in a given treatment.
 In the rest of this section we will be using power cost function for illustrati

The baseline treatment is the traditional bilateral gift exchange game

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 in which an employer chooses a wage, worker observes the wage and then
 work on the task.
 We allow employers to select any wage between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 cents while workers work on a simple button-pressing task for 10 minutes

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We use the exact same task as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 From the MTurk standards this variation in piece rates is substantial for
 the 10 minute task.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These piece rates provide evidence on the responsiveness of effort to incentives
 for this particular task and hence allow us to estimate parameters of cost
 function which will be used to estimate other behavioral parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, in the baseline treatment, employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 selects a piece rate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 for worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, worker observe the piece rate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 and then choose effort 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by maximizing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Worker do no observe the identity of the employer which implies that for
 any worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{iW}=s_{iB}=s_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{iW}=Y_{iB}=Y_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The equilibrium effort 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 in this treatment will be given as; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{i}^{\star}=c'^{-1}\left(s_{i}+p+Y_{i}\left(p-p_{i}^{fair}\right)\right)\text{ for }i\in\left\{ B,W\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This treatment will give us the baseline measure of effort of worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at the piece rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, the solution of effort has two behavioral unknowns (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

), and two unknowns from cost function (
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

).
 We will back out these unknowns from the observed effort at different piece
 rates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Race Salient Treatment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the race salient treatment, workers will observe the race of the matched
 employer along with the selected piece rate and then work on a task.
 In the presence of group biases i.e.
 when workers derive different level of social preference for different
 employers' group then;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{ij}^{RS}=c'^{-1}\left(\left(s_{i}+\Delta s_{ij}^{RS}\right)+p+\left(Y_{i}+\Delta Y_{ij}\right)\left(p-p_{i}^{fair}\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are implicitly assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{ij}=s_{i}+\Delta s_{ij}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{ij}$
\end_inset

 can be separated into two components 1) 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

, which is independent of the employer type and include everything such
 as sense of duty, norm, intrinsict motivation, competitiveness of worker
 etc.
 and 2) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta s_{ij}$
\end_inset

, which represents additional utility or disutility from working for the
 employer of type 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 which we interpret as taste towards the employer a' la

 For

 will be interpreted as the decrease in effort due to taste bias of worker
 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 towards the opposite group employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the difference in effort towards the white employer and
 black employer 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(e_{iW}^{RS}-e_{iB}^{RS}\right)$
\end_inset

 is construed as a difference which is only driven by the taste bias of
 the workers of group

\begin_layout Subsection
Three Stage Treatment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fehr1997"

\end_inset

 we introduce a third stage to the baseline treatment.
 In this treatment, employer will select piece rate and workers will work
 on a task exactly as in baseline treatment, however there will be a third
 stage in which the employer will decide whether to reward a bonus to the
 worker after observing the effort choice.
 Bonus will be costly to employers.
 So the worker's problem would look like this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\underbrace{max}_{e_{ij}\geq0}\left(s_{ij}+p\right)e_{ij}-c(e_{ij})+\pi_{ij}(e_{ij})Bonus
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{ij}(e_{ij})$
\end_inset

 is the probability that an employer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 will offer a Bonus to worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 In the presence of reciprocal employers, we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{ij}'(e)>0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 higher effort increases the probabity of bonus being rewarded.
 If workers expect employers to be reciprocal than they will increase their
 effort in this treatment as compared to baseline treatment.
 If we assume probability to be a linear function of effort, and since employer'
s identity is not observed by workers 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\pi_{ij}=\pi_{i}\forall j\in\left\{ B,W\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

, then effort in this treatment will be given as; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{i}^{TS}=c'^{-1}\left(s_{i}+p+\pi_{i}Bonus\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This treatment will give us the baseline measure of effort of worker 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in the presence of uncertainty about the Bonus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Race Salient and Three Stage

This treatment is the combination of race salient and three stage treatments.
 The effort in this treatment will be given as;

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now if 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{W|j=B}^{RSTS}<e_{W}^{TS}$

Recruitment of Subjects

\begin_layout Standard
The subjects for this experiment will be recruited from an online labor

 Upwork is one of the largest online labor market in the world with over
 twelve million registered freelancers, earning more than a billion dollars
 via the site each year

 Unlike Amazon's Mechanical Turk, another online labor market used in economics
 research, upwork employers have complete discretion in whom they hire and
 they have real relationships with hired workers.
 Another benefit of using Upwork is that employers can monitor the workers'
 progress while the task is being performed.
 Workers log in to upwork applicaiton that shows employers when they are
 working.
 The application records keystroke volume and shows screenshots of the worker's
 computer screen, taken six times per hour.

 For every application that we receive from worker, we will examine the
 profile picture of the applicant to see if the subject fall into a any
 of the two races that we are interested in i.e.
 Black or White (Figure

This experiment is designed to measure whether workers discrininate in reciproci
ty based on the race of the employer and which economic theory explains
 the source of discrimination.
 The experiment is a 2-factor design with treatments as follows; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Baseline Treatment

 This is a two-person game consisting of two stages.
 In the first stage, an employer decide how much wage to offer to a worker.
 Worker observes the wage offer in the second stage and choose effort level.
 Effort is costly to workers but profitable to employers.
 Wage is costly to employer but profitable to worker.
 All earnings in the experiment will be calculated in the unit of points
 which will be converted to US dollars at the end of experiment with the
 exchange rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\text{ point}=10\text{ cents}$

 As mentioned earlier, subjects will play this game for 10 periods, one
 of those 10 periods will be randomly selected and the payment to the subject
 will be determined on the basis of payoff in that period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid reputation effects, a worker in each period will be told that it
 is partnered with a new employer i.e.
 a worker will be told that it will never be matched with the same employer
 again.
 Worker will also be told that the game will proceed anonymously i.e.
 employer will never observe the identity of a worker.
 In the absence of social preference, a worker should always choose minimum
 effort (
\begin_inset Formula $e_{min}$
\end_inset

) irrespective of the wage offer.
 As once the wage is determined there is no pecuniary incentive to choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $e>e_{min}.$
\end_inset

 In this experiment we are only interested in the worker's problem, therefore
 there will be no real employers and wages by the employers will be randomly
 determined.
 Random wages are introduced to give more control on the experiment and
 to avoid any confounds from employer choice that may influence worker's
 effort choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we agree that deception should be discouraged in labortary experiments,
 our experiment does not violate any of the ethical concerns associated
 with deception.
 We were careful to follow APA guidelines for deception.
 There appear to be three concerns at stake regardign deception.
 First, there is the argument that deception will harm the subjects.
 This argument is not relevant in this case because we don't see how subjects
 can be harmed by the deception in this case.
 The earnings of the subjects are not affected because of this deception
 as compared to having real people playing the game.
 Second, there is the argument that deception will 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

poison
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the subject pool for future experiments.
 We avoid this problem by not debriefing the subjects about this deception.
 Debriefing the subjects can broadcast the deception to other potential
 subjects and hence potentially affect their behavior in future experiments.
 Third, the suspicion of deception may bias the results of the experiment.
 If such a bias exist it will bias the results in the direction of null
 effect.

 Chicago Face Database (CFD) is a free resource consisting of 158 high-resolutio

 the ages of 18 and 40 years.
 These photographs are rated on a number of different psychological dimensions
 (e.g.
 attractiveness and trustworthiness).
 Using pictures from CFD (compared to using pictures of real people) offer
 us the better experimental control and is also cost-effective.

\begin_layout Standard
As argued in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Fehr1997"

\end_inset

, the introduction of this third stage should not have any impact at all.
 Employers should never punish or reward workers since it is costly to them
 i.e.
 they will choose 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

.
 Workers should anticipate that and should choose the same effort as in
 Basline treatment.
 However if workers expect employers to have positve (negative) reciprocity
 towards a worker, it may expect employers to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $p>1$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p<1$
\end_inset

).
 Worker may think that if the employer is happy (unhappy) with the effort
 choice, it may decide to reward (punish) them.
 So workers should choose higher effort to elicit the positive reciprocity
 or to avoid the negative reciprocity from the employer.
 Hence we expect the effort to be higher in this treatment as compared to
 the baseline treatement.

\begin_layout Standard
The way the expectations will form in this case is not very clear.
 Workers may also take into account the wage offer from the first stage
 to form expectations about the conditional probability of rewarded a bonus.
 For example workers may expect an employer with higher wage offer to be
 willing to reward the bonus more easily than the employer who offered lower
 wage in the first stage or the relationship may be opposite becuase the
 wage goes out of the employer's payoff and it is aimed at eliciting more
 effort from worker but bonus doesn't affect employer payoff.
 Hence apriori we are not sure on the direction of average effort in the
 bonus treatment.

Race Salient and Bonus Treatment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This treatment is a combination of Race Salient and Bonus treatments.
 Workers will see the picture of the person (as in race salient treatment)
 and will also be informed of the additional stage of the game (as in Bonus
 treatment).

We use data from baseline treatment to estimate parameters of cost function
 and baseline parameters.
 Given 20 moments (mean efforts from 10 different piece rates for each of
 the two types of workers) we are able to estimate 6 parameters
